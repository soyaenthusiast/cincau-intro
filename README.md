## :cowboy_hat_face: Who is me?
Hi! My name is Faris and I am a graduated Chemical Engineer now an aspiring Data Freak. I love working with data, tossing data around, enriching and delivering value with the data that I have. Working from ingestion, to manipulation and finally visualisation. 

## :exploding_head: What work do I do and what are my aspirations?
The purpose of my GitHub page is to showcase data works that I have done in my free time outside of my professional work life. I have started to learn about coding (specifically python) in 2020 through my own self learning and have developed my interest from there on. I have done some personal and professional work with using python, but I have not had a central platform where I could showcase my basic-intermediate work to the wider public. Hence, the existence of this github page to showcase my work and also acts as an extension arm to my overall data portoflio works :smiley_cat:

My aspirations is to be able to bridge the gap between technology and engineering together - to be able to fully utilise the available data that we have and create value out of it. To automate tedious processes, help in decision making and make work more fun!

## :thought_balloon: Where can I find your personal works
Kindly go through my repo - if you have any questions feel free to contact me :smile_cat:

I am open for any freelancing work that has to do with data analysis and data visualisation as it is (for now) my biggest sword in my backpack.
