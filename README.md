## :cowboy_hat_face: Who is me?
Hi! My name is Faris and I am a graduated Chemical Engineer now an aspiring Data Freak. I love working with data, tossing data around, enriching and delivering value with the data that I have. Working from ingestion, to manipulation, to visualisation and finally stakeholder/client delivery. 

Used to study and crack my head to solve formulas, numbers and ```f(x)-ses``` for the sake of _good grades_ -- now I use data generated from formulas to guide decisions worth thousands of monetary/non-monetary value. 

## :exploding_head: What work do I do and what are my aspirations?
The purpose of my GitHub page is to showcase data works that I have done in my free time outside of my professional work life. I have started to learn about coding (specifically python) in 2020 through my own self learning and have developed my interest from there on. I have done some personal and professional work with using python, but I have not had a central platform where I could showcase my basic-intermediate work to the wider public. Hence, the existence of this github page to showcase my work and also acts as an extension arm to my overall data portoflio works :smiley_cat:

My aspirations is to be able to bridge the gap between technology and engineering together - to be able to fully utilise the available data that we have and create value out of it. To automate tedious processes, help in decision making and make work more fun!

Some personal work that has helped my daily life:
* Financial dashboard: To track my overall spending habits, savings and whether I am living
* Apple Health Dashboard: To track whether I am living healthily and not a couch rat

## :thought_balloon: Where can I find your personal works
Kindly go through my repo - if you have any questions feel free to contact me :smile_cat:

I am open for any freelancing work that has to do with data analysis and data visualisation as it is (for now) my biggest sword in my backpack.
